\title{Define a Common Latent Factor for the Dynamite Model.}
\usage{
lfactor(
  responses = NULL,
  nonzero_lambda = TRUE,
  correlated = TRUE,
  noncentered_psi = FALSE,
  flip_sign = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{responses}{[\code{character()}]\cr Names of the responses that the
factor should affect. Default is all responses defined with
\code{obs} except categorical responses, which do not (yet) support the factor
component.}

\item{nonzero_lambda}{[\code{logical()}]\cr If \code{TRUE} (the default), assumes
that the mean of factor loadings is nonzero or not. Should be a logical
vector matching the length of \code{responses} or a single logical value in
case \code{responses} is \code{NULL}. See details.}

\item{correlated}{[\code{logical()}]\cr If \code{TRUE} (the default), the latent
factors are assumed to be correlated between channels.}

\item{noncentered_psi}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr If \code{TRUE}, uses a
noncentered parametrization for spline coefficients of all the factors.
The number of knots is based \code{splines()} call. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{flip_sign}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr If \code{TRUE} (default), try to avoid
multimodality due to sign-switching by defining the sign of \eqn{\lambda}
and \eqn{\psi} based on the mean of \eqn{\omega_1,\ldots, \omega_D}
coefficients. This only affects channels with \code{nonzero_lambda = FALSE}.
If the true mean of \eqn{\omega}s is close to zero, this might not help,
in which case it is better to set \code{flip_sign = FALSE} and post-process the
samples in other ways (or use only one chain and/or suitable initial
values). This argument is common to all factors.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{latent_factor}.
}
\description{
This function can be used as part of \code{\link[=dynamiteformula]{dynamiteformula()}} to define
a common latent factor component. The latent factor is modeled as a spline
similarly as a time-varying intercept, but instead of having equal effect on
each group, there is an additional loading variable for each group so that
in the linear predictor we have a term \eqn{\lambda_i \psi_t} for each
group \eqn{i}.
