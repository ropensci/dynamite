#' Define a Common Latent Factor for the Dynamite Model.
#'
#' This function can be used as part of [dynamite::dynamiteformula()] to define
#' a common latent factor component. The latent factor is modeled as a spline
#' similarly as a time-varying intercept, but instead of having equal effect on
#' each group, there is an additional loading variable for each group so that
#' in the linear predictor we have a term \eqn{\lambda_i \psi_t} for each
#' group \eqn{i}. In order to keep the full factor loadings \eqn{\lambda},
#' the latent factor \eqn{\psi} and the full model identifiable, some
#' restrictions are added to the model. Details will be available in an
#' upcoming paper. This component should be treated as experimental feature.

#' @param responses \[`character()`]\cr Names of the responses that the
#'   factor should affect. Default is all responses defined with
#'   `obs` except categorical responses, which do not (yet) support the factor
#'   component.
#' @param nonzero_lambda \[`logical()`]\cr If `TRUE` (the default), assumes
#'   that the mean of factor loadings is nonzero or not. Should be a logical
#'   vector matching the length of `responses` or a single logical value in
#'   case `responses` is `NULL`. See details.
#' @param correlated \[`logical()`]\cr If `TRUE` (the default), the latent
#'   factors are assumed to be correlated between channels.
#' @param noncentered_psi \[`logical(1)`]\cr If `TRUE`, uses a
#'   noncentered parametrization for spline coefficients of all the factors.
#'   The number of knots is based `splines()` call.
#' @return An object of class `latent_factor`.
