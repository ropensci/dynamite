Description: Easy-to-use and efficient interface for 
  Bayesian inference of complex panel (time series) data using dynamic 
  multivariate panel models by the Authors (2022). 
  The package supports joint modeling of multiple 
  measurements per individual, time-varying and time-invariant effects, and a 
  wide range of discrete and continuous distributions. Estimation of these 
  dynamic multivariate panel models is carried out via 'Stan'. For an 
  in-depth tutorial of the package, see the package vignette.
